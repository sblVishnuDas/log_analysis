Log Data for Project

The log analysis system consists of four main scripts (master_report_migration.py for retrieving production planned records, migration.py for migrating data from Excel to the database, run.py for executing multiple scripts based on their functions, and folder.py for automating log folder extraction) working with an eleven-table database structure that stores comprehensive information about production data, locations, projects, team leads, employees, daily records, work sessions, durations, OCR processing, data updates, and shortcut usage to track and analyze workflow metrics across various projects and locations.
